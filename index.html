        <p class="lead">Hi, welcome to my page! My name is Leah and I am an aspiring coder. Here is a little bit about
          me! I was born in Boston but soon after I was born, I moved to San Diego, where I lived my entire childhood.
          Growing up in San Diego is something I wouldn't trade for the world. It is the most beautiful, wonderful
          place. If you haven't visited you should book your trip now!</p>
        <p class="lead">I attended college at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Ann Arbor is a small, cute
          college town located about 40 mins from metro Detroit. I loved my four years there, and made some of my best
          friends in the world. There are also a large number of Univeristy of Michigan alumni in Seattle.</p>
        <p class="lead">The most important thing in my life is my dog, Daisy. She is a 2.5 year old toy Australian
          Shepherd. Weighing in at 10.5 lbs, she is little but fierce! She is such a character and has a crazy
          personality. She looks bigger than she is, but has a ton of fluff and a gorgeous long coat. She is an angel
          girl and even though I got her in college (which obviously was not the responsible thing to do) it turned out
          to be the best decision I have ever made.</p>
